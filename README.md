# memeql-frontend

This is the frontend for MemeQL, described in a more overall sense here: https://github.com/memeql/memeql<br>

This frontend uses React and Bootstrap to deliver a delightfully minimal user experience. In an age overwhelmed with effects, colors, and designs, this frontend offers simplicity above all else, showing only the elements strictly speaking needed and useful to a user at any given time. No sensory overload, just content. 

## Technical Notes

There are some defects that need to be addressed: 
1. Leftovers of the development scaffolding, including the Demo component and page, need to be removed.
2. The lead developer needs to spend some time on understanding what is a component vs. what is a page, and act accordingly. 
3. Global state should probably be implemented to make user information available throughout the application.
